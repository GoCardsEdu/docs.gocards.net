Export your flashcard decks to Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) files to edit on your computer, share with others, or create backups. This is a **Premium feature**.

## Why Export Cards?

### Edit on Computer
- **Larger screen** - Easier than phone keyboard
- **Bulk editing** - Use Excel's find-replace, formulas
- **Faster data entry** - Create many cards quickly
- **Organize in spreadsheet** - Sort, filter, categorize

### Share Decks
- **Send to friends** - They can import to their GoCards
- **Share with study group** - Everyone gets same cards
- **Publish online** - Share via cloud storage or email
- **Content only** - No learning progress included (privacy)

### Backup Content
- **File-based backup** - In addition to database backup
- **Human-readable** - Open in any spreadsheet app
- **Edit offline** - Make changes without app

### Set Up Sync
- **First step to syncing** - Export creates the initial file
- **Then sync regularly** - Bi-directional updates
- See [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for details

## Export File Formats

### Excel (.xlsx)

**Best for:**
- ✅ Editing with formulas and formatting
- ✅ Rich text editing
- ✅ Sorting and filtering
- ✅ Opening in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice

**File size:** Slightly larger than CSV

---

### CSV (.csv)

**Best for:**
- ✅ Universal compatibility (any text editor can open)
- ✅ Smaller file size
- ✅ Programmatic processing (scripts, code)
- ✅ Importing to other apps

**Limitations:**
- No formatting (plain text only)
- Commas in content require quotes
- Less user-friendly for manual editing

---

## What Gets Exported?

### Included in Export

✅ **Card terms** (questions/prompts)
✅ **Card definitions** (answers)
✅ **Card order** (ordinal/position)
✅ **HTML formatting** (if present in cards)
✅ **Disabled status** (optional column)

### NOT Included in Export

❌ **Learning progress** (review intervals, memorization status)
❌ **Study history** (past grading button clicks)
❌ **Last studied date**
❌ **Statistics** (success rate, total reviews)

**Why?** Exports are for content sharing/editing, not progress transfer. Use [Database Export](/docs/home/database-backup/) to include learning progress.

## File Structure

### Excel/CSV Column Layout

| Column A | Column B | Column C (optional) |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Term | Definition | Disabled |
| What is DNA? | Deoxyribonucleic acid... | FALSE |
| Capital of France? | Paris | FALSE |
| What is H2O? | Water | FALSE |

**Column details:**
- **Term** - Front of flashcard (question/prompt)
- **Definition** - Back of flashcard (answer)
- **Disabled** - TRUE/FALSE (optional, if card is disabled)

**Header row:** First row contains column names ("Term", "Definition", "Disabled")

## Editing Exported Files

### In Microsoft Excel

1. **Open** the exported .xlsx file
2. **Edit cells** as needed:
   - Add new rows (new cards)
   - Delete rows (remove cards)
   - Modify terms/definitions
   - Reorder rows (changes card order)
3. **Save** the file
4. **Sync or re-import** to GoCards

**Tip:** Keep the file in Google Drive and use [Cloud Storage Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/cloud-storage/) for automatic updates.

---

### In Text Editor (CSV only)

1. **Open** .csv in Notepad, VS Code, etc.
2. **Edit** carefully (CSV format is sensitive)
   ```csv
   Term,Definition,Disabled
   "What is DNA?","Deoxyribonucleic acid",FALSE
   "Capital of France?","Paris",FALSE
   ```
3. **Save** with UTF-8 encoding
4. **Sync or re-import** to GoCards

## Tips for Successful Exporting

### Name Files Descriptively

**Good:**
- `Spanish-Verbs-Advanced-2025-12-29.xlsx`
- `Biology-Chapter3-Cells.xlsx`

**Bad:**
- `export.xlsx` (which deck is this?)
- `deck123.csv` (not descriptive)

---

### Save to Cloud Storage

**Benefits:**
- Automatic backup
- Access from multiple devices
- Easy sharing

### Keep Original Exports

**Before major edits:**
1. Export deck
2. **Rename** to `DeckName-ORIGINAL.xlsx`
3. **Duplicate** the file
4. Edit the duplicate
5. **If editing fails:** You still have the original

---

### Test With Small Deck First

**Before exporting your 1000-card deck:**
1. Create a 5-card test deck
2. Export it
3. Edit in Excel
4. Re-import or sync
5. **Verify everything works**
6. Then do your large deck
