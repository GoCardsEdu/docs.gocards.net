Solutions to common sync, import, and export problems in GoCards.

## Sync Issues

### Cards Not Updating

**Problem:** Edited file but cards unchanged in GoCards

**Solutions:**
1. **Manual sync:** Deck menu → "Sync with file"
2. **Check auto-sync:** Deck Settings → Verify "Auto-Sync" is ON
3. **Verify file:** Open file, confirm edits are saved
4. **Re-link file:** Deck Settings → Unlink → Re-link file
5. **Check timestamps:** File modification date should be recent

### Sync Shows "Conflict"

**Problem:** Both app and file edited since last sync

**How GoCards handles it:**
- Compares modification timestamps
- **Newest change wins**
- Older change is overwritten

**Prevention:**
- Sync before editing in both places
- Use only one editing location at a time
- Check last sync time before editing

### Sync Deletes Cards

**Problem:** Cards disappeared after sync

**Causes:**
- Cards deleted from Excel file
- Rows removed accidentally
- File replaced with old version

**Recovery:**
1. **Check Excel file** - Are cards still there?
2. **Restore from backup** - Use previous export/database backup
3. **Disable auto-sync** temporarily while investigating

### Sync Too Slow

**Problem:** Sync takes minutes to complete

**Causes:**
- Large images embedded in cards
- Many cards (1000+)
- Slow internet connection
- Cloud storage throttling

**Solutions:**
- Compress images before adding to cards
- Split large decks into smaller ones
- Use WiFi instead of mobile data
- Wait during first sync (subsequent syncs are faster)

## Import Issues

### "Invalid File Format"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check header row:** Must have "Term" and "Definition"
2. **Verify file extension:** .xlsx or .csv
3. **Open in Excel:** Ensure file isn't corrupted
4. **Re-save file:** Save as → Excel Workbook (.xlsx)

### "No Cards Found"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check for data:** File must have rows beyond header
2. **Remove empty rows:** Delete blank rows between cards
3. **Verify column names:** Exactly "Term" and "Definition" (case-sensitive)

### Cards Import With Weird Characters

**Problem:** Special characters show as "?" or "□"

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Excel format:** .xlsx handles encoding better than .csv
2. **CSV encoding:** Save as UTF-8 (not ANSI)
3. **Check source:** Copy-paste may introduce encoding issues

### HTML Tags Show As Text

**Problem:** See `<b>text</b>` instead of **text**

**Explanation:** This is normal in Excel. HTML renders correctly in GoCards study mode.

**Verification:**
1. Import the file
2. Study a card
3. HTML should render properly

## Export Issues

### Export Button Grayed Out

**Cause:** Premium feature not unlocked

**Solution:** Upgrade to GoCards Premium

### Export Fails or Crashes

**Solutions:**
1. **Free up storage:** Ensure 100+ MB available
2. **Reduce deck size:** Export smaller decks
3. **Remove large images:** Temporarily delete image-heavy cards
4. **Restart app:** Force close and reopen GoCards

### Can't Find Exported File

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Downloads folder**
2. **Check selected save location** (you chose where to save)
3. **Use file manager app** to search for filename
4. **Check cloud storage** if you saved there

## File Format Issues

### Excel Says "File Corrupted"

**Solutions:**
1. **Re-export from GoCards**
2. **Try CSV format** instead
3. **Update Excel** to latest version
4. **Open in Google Sheets** (more forgiving)

### Commas Break CSV File

**Problem:** Definitions with commas cause formatting issues

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Excel format** (.xlsx) - No comma problems
2. **CSV with quotes:** Ensure values with commas are quoted: `"Hello, world"`
3. **Edit in Excel:** It handles CSV formatting automatically

## Permission Issues

### "Cannot Access File"

**Solutions:**
1. **Grant storage permission:** Settings → Apps → GoCards → Permissions → Storage
2. **Cloud storage permission:** Install cloud app (Drive/Dropbox)
3. **File location:** Ensure file is in accessible location

### "File is Read-Only"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check file properties:** Remove read-only attribute
2. **Cloud storage:** Verify you have edit permission
3. **File in use:** Close Excel/other apps using the file

## Data Loss Prevention

### Always Backup Before:

- Major sync operations
- Bulk deletions
- Restructuring decks
- Experimenting with new features

### Backup Methods:

1. **Database export:** Full backup with progress
2. **Excel export:** Content-only backup
3. **Cloud storage:** Automatic file versioning
