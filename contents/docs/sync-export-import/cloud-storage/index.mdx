Use cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox with GoCards for automatic file syncing, cross-device access, and convenient backup.

## Supported Cloud Services

GoCards works with any cloud storage that provides file access on Android:

- ✅ **Google Drive** - Best integration, recommended
- ✅ **Dropbox** - Good performance
- ✅ **OneDrive** - Works well
- ✅ **Box** - Supported
- ⚠️ **iCloud** - Limited on Android

## Setup Workflow

### 1. Install Cloud Storage App

**For Google Drive:**
- Pre-installed on most Android devices
- Or download from Play Store

**For Dropbox:**
- Install Dropbox app from Play Store
- Sign in to your account

### 2. Export Deck to Cloud Storage

1. **Open deck** → **"List Cards"** → **"⋮" menu**
2. **Select "Export to Excel"**
3. **Choose cloud storage location**:
   - Tap "Save to" → Google Drive or Dropbox folder
4. **File saves to cloud** and syncs automatically

### 3. Link File to Deck (Premium)

1. **Deck menu** → **"More"** → **"Sync with file"**
2. **Browse to file** in cloud storage
3. **Select the file**
4. **Deck is now linked** to cloud file

### 4. Enable Auto-Sync (Premium)

1. **Deck menu** → **"More"** → **"Deck Settings"**
2. **Toggle "Auto-Sync" ON**
3. **Deck syncs automatically:**
   - When you open the deck
   - When you close the deck
   - Keeps everything up to date

## How It Works

### On Your Computer

1. **Open cloud folder** (Google Drive, Dropbox app/website)
2. **Edit the Excel file** (add/modify/delete cards)
3. **Save changes** - File syncs to cloud automatically

### On Your Phone

1. **Open deck in GoCards**
2. **Auto-sync triggers** (if enabled)
3. **GoCards downloads latest file** from cloud
4. **Cards update** to match file
5. **Study with updated content**

### Two-Way Sync

- **Edit in GoCards** → Changes sync to cloud file
- **Edit in Excel** → Changes sync to GoCards
- **Conflicts resolved** by timestamp (newest wins)

## Best Practices

### Use Dedicated Folder

**Create "GoCards" folder** in cloud storage:
```
Google Drive/
└── GoCards/
    ├── Spanish-Vocabulary.xlsx
    ├── Biology-Chapter1.xlsx
    └── Math-Formulas.xlsx
```

**Benefits:**
- Organized
- Easy to find files
- Can share entire folder with study group

### Reliable Internet

**Auto-sync requires:**
- Active internet connection (WiFi or mobile data)
- Cloud storage app installed and signed in
- File permissions granted to GoCards

### File Naming

**Use descriptive, unique names:**
- ✅ `Spanish-Verbs-Advanced.xlsx`
- ❌ `deck.xlsx` (too generic)

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Fails - "Cannot Access File"

**Causes:**
- Cloud app not installed or signed out
- Internet connection lost
- File was moved/renamed/deleted

**Solutions:**
1. Open cloud storage app, verify file exists
2. Check internet connection
3. Re-link file in Deck Settings

### Changes Not Syncing

**Check:**
- Auto-sync is enabled
- Cloud app is running (not force-stopped)
- File has write permissions
- Internet is stable

### Slow Sync

**Causes:**
- Large file with many images
- Slow internet connection
- Cloud service throttling

**Solutions:**
- Use WiFi instead of mobile data
- Reduce image sizes in cards
- Wait for sync to complete
