Detailed specifications for creating Excel (.xlsx) and CSV (.csv) files compatible with GoCards.

## Required File Structure

### Column Headers (Row 1)

| Column | Required | Data Type | Description |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Term** | ✅ Required | Text | Question/prompt (front of card) |
| **Definition** | ✅ Required | Text | Answer (back of card) |
| **Disabled** | ❌ Optional | Boolean | TRUE/FALSE - card enabled status |

**Important:**
- Column names are case-sensitive: "Term" not "term" or "TERM"
- Header row must be first row (row 1)
- Order doesn't matter, but Term and Definition are typically columns A and B

### Data Rows (Row 2 onward)

Each row represents one flashcard:

```
Row 1: Term | Definition | Disabled
Row 2: What is DNA? | Deoxyribonucleic acid | FALSE
Row 3: Capital of France? | Paris | FALSE
Row 4: Chemical formula for water? | H2O | FALSE
```

## Excel Format (.xlsx)

### Cell Formatting

**Text formatting:**
- Plain text or General format (default)
- Avoid Date formatting (may misinterpret content)
- Long text is fine (no character limit per cell)

**HTML support:**
- HTML tags in cells render in GoCards: `<b>Bold</b>`
- Keep HTML simple (avoid complex styling)

**Line breaks:**
- Press Alt+Enter in Excel for line breaks within cell
- Renders as multiple lines in GoCards

### Special Characters

Excel .xlsx format supports:
- ✅ Accented characters: é, ñ, ü, etc.
- ✅ Symbols: ©, ™, °, etc.
- ✅ Emoji: 😀, 🎓, ✅, etc.
- ✅ Mathematical symbols: ∞, ≈, ≠, etc.

No special encoding needed.

### Images

**Inline images not supported**. Instead:
- Use HTML image tags: `<img src="URL">`
- Host images online (Google Drive, Imgur, etc.)
- Include URL in cell content

**Example:**
```
Definition: <img src="https://example.com/diagram.png"><br>Diagram shows cell structure
```

### Multiple Sheets

**GoCards reads only the first sheet (Sheet1)**

- Additional sheets ignored during import/sync
- Keep all cards on Sheet1
- Other sheets can store notes, references (won't import)

### Additional Columns

**Extra columns are allowed:**
- Columns beyond Term, Definition, Disabled are ignored by GoCards
- Useful for: notes, tags, sources, chapter numbers
- **Preserved during sync** - GoCards won't delete them
- Rows stay together during sync (extra data moves with card)

**Example:**
```
Term | Definition | Disabled | Chapter | Notes
```

GoCards uses first 3 columns, preserves last 2.

## CSV Format (.csv)

### Basic Structure

```csv
Term,Definition,Disabled
"What is DNA?","Deoxyribonucleic acid",FALSE
"Capital of France?","Paris",FALSE
```

### CSV Rules

**Commas:**
- Field separator is comma
- Values containing commas must be quoted: `"Hello, world"`

**Quotes:**
- Use double quotes `"` to enclose values with commas
- Escape quotes inside values: `"He said ""Hello"""`

**Line breaks:**
- Values with line breaks must be quoted
- Line breaks preserved within quotes

**Encoding:**
- **UTF-8** encoding required for special characters
- ANSI/ASCII may corrupt accented characters

### Saving CSV Properly

**From Excel:**
1. File → Save As → CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)
2. **Not:** CSV (Comma delimited) - This uses ANSI encoding

**From Google Sheets:**
1. File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)
2. Automatically uses UTF-8

**From text editor:**
1. Use UTF-8 encoding (not ANSI)
2. Save with .csv extension

### CSV Limitations

Compared to Excel:
- ❌ No cell formatting (bold, colors, etc.)
- ❌ More prone to encoding issues
- ❌ Easy to break with manual editing
- ✅ Smaller file size
- ✅ Universal compatibility

**Recommendation:** Use Excel (.xlsx) unless you have specific need for CSV.

## Data Validation

### Valid Values

**Term column:**
- Non-empty text
- HTML allowed
- Special characters allowed
- Recommended: 1-200 characters

**Definition column:**
- Non-empty text
- HTML allowed
- Special characters allowed
- Can be longer than Term

**Disabled column:**
- `TRUE` or `FALSE` (case-insensitive)
- `true`, `True`, `TRUE` all work
- Empty cells treated as FALSE
- Other values (1/0, Yes/No) may not work

### Empty Rows

- Empty rows skipped during import
- Don't affect sync
- Safe to leave blank rows between groups of cards

### Invalid Data

**What happens:**
- Rows with empty Term or Definition are skipped
- Warning may be shown
- Other valid rows still import

## File Size Considerations

### Performance

| Cards | File Size (approx) | Import Time |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 100 | 50 KB | <1 second |
| 1,000 | 500 KB | 2-3 seconds |
| 10,000 | 5 MB | 10-20 seconds |

**With images (embedded URLs):**
- URL text is tiny (file size barely increases)
- Actual images aren't in file (hosted externally)
- Sync time depends on image download

### Limits

**Practical limits:**
- **Cards per deck:** 10,000+ supported (may be slow)
- **Text per cell:** Essentially unlimited
- **File size:** Android system limits (usually 100+ MB fine)

**Recommendations:**
- Split very large decks (1000+ cards) for better performance
- Keep images under 500KB each for fast loading
- Compress images before hosting

## Example Files

### Minimal Valid File

```
Term,Definition
What is DNA?,Deoxyribonucleic acid
Capital of France?,Paris
```

### Complete Example

```
Term,Definition,Disabled
"What is <b>DNA</b>?","Deoxyribonucleic acid - genetic material",FALSE
"Capital of France?","<b>Paris</b><br>Population: ~2.2 million",FALSE
"H<sub>2</sub>O formula?","Water (2 hydrogen, 1 oxygen)",FALSE
"Difficult card","I always forget this",TRUE
```

### With Extra Columns

```
Term,Definition,Disabled,Chapter,Source
What is DNA?,Deoxyribonucleic acid,FALSE,1,Textbook p.45
Capital of France?,Paris,FALSE,3,Geography notes
```

## Troubleshooting Format Issues

### Import Fails - Check:

1. ✅ Header row has "Term" and "Definition"
2. ✅ At least one data row exists
3. ✅ File extension is .xlsx or .csv
4. ✅ File isn't corrupted (opens in Excel)

### Sync Issues - Check:

1. ✅ File structure unchanged (same columns)
2. ✅ File encoding is correct (UTF-8 for CSV)
3. ✅ No locked/read-only file
4. ✅ File hasn't been moved/renamed
