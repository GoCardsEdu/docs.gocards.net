Import flashcard decks from Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) files to quickly create new decks, migrate from other apps, or restore backups. This is a **Premium feature**.

## How to Import Cards

### From Home Screen (Premium)

1. **Go to home screen** (Recent Decks or All Decks tab)
2. **Tap "⋮" menu** (top-right)
3. **Select "Import Excel"** or **"Import CSV"**
4. **Browse to your file** (Downloads, Google Drive, etc.)
5. **Select the file**
6. **New deck is created** with the filename as deck name

---

## File Format Requirements

### Required Columns

Your file must contain these columns (header row):

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Term** | ✅ Yes | Front of card (question/prompt) |
| **Definition** | ✅ Yes | Back of card (answer) |
| **Disabled** | ❌ Optional | TRUE/FALSE (whether card is disabled) |

### Example File Structure

```
| Term                    | Definition                      | Disabled |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|----------|
| What is DNA?            | Deoxyribonucleic acid...        | FALSE    |
| Capital of France?      | Paris                           | FALSE    |
| What is photosynthesis? | Process of converting light...  | FALSE    |
```

**Important:**
- First row must be headers: "Term", "Definition", "Disabled"
- Term and Definition columns are required
- Disabled column is optional
- Additional columns are ignored (but preserved during sync)

See [File Format Guide](/docs/sync-export-import/file-format/) for detailed specifications.

## What Gets Imported

### Included
✅ **All card terms and definitions** from the file
✅ **Card order** (row order becomes card order)
✅ **HTML formatting** (if present in cells)
✅ **Disabled status** (if Disabled column exists)
✅ **Empty rows** are skipped

### Not Included
❌ **Learning progress** (imports create new cards with no history)
❌ **Study statistics** (starts fresh)
❌ **Review intervals** (cards treated as new)

**Why?** Import is for content only. Use [Database Import](/docs/home/database-backup/) to include learning progress.

---

## Import Use Cases

### Migrate from Another App

**From Anki, Quizlet, etc.:**
1. Export from other app (usually CSV format)
2. Open in Excel to verify/adjust format
3. Ensure columns are "Term" and "Definition"
4. Save as .xlsx or .csv
5. Import to GoCards

---

### Bulk Card Creation

**Create 100 cards quickly:**
1. Open Excel/Google Sheets
2. Type or paste terms in Column A
3. Type or paste definitions in Column B
4. Add header row: "Term", "Definition"
5. Save and import to GoCards
6. Much faster than typing on phone!

---

### Restore From Backup

**If you exported cards previously:**
1. Locate your backup .xlsx/.csv file
2. Import to GoCards
3. New deck created with all cards
4. ⚠️ Learning progress won't be restored (use .db backup for that)

---

### Share Received Decks

**Study group shared a deck:**
1. Download the shared Excel/CSV file
2. Import to GoCards
3. Start studying immediately
4. Everyone has same cards (separate progress)

---

## Preparing Files for Import

### In Excel

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Open Excel** → Create new workbook
2. **First row:** Type headers: `Term`, `Definition`, `Disabled`
3. **Second row onward:** Enter your cards
4. **Format cells:** Plain text or general (avoid date formatting)
5. **Save as:** .xlsx (Excel) or .csv (CSV)
6. **Transfer to phone** (cloud storage, email, etc.)
7. **Import to GoCards**

---

### In Google Sheets

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Create new Google Sheet**
2. **Add headers and cards** (same as Excel)
3. **File → Download** → Choose format:
   - Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
   - Comma-separated values (.csv)
4. **Download to phone** or save to Google Drive
5. **Import to GoCards**

---

### CSV Format Details

**Example CSV file:**
```csv
Term,Definition,Disabled
"What is DNA?","Deoxyribonucleic acid",FALSE
"Capital of France?","Paris",FALSE
```

**CSV Rules:**
- Comma-separated values
- Quotes around values with commas: `"Hello, world"`
- UTF-8 encoding (for special characters)
- Header row required

**Tip:** Excel handles CSV formatting automatically. Manual CSV editing can be error-prone.

---

## After Importing

### Verify Import Success

1. **Open the newly created deck**
2. **Tap "List Cards"**
3. **Scroll through** to verify all cards imported
4. **Check counts:** Does card count match file row count?

---

### Edit Imported Cards

If formatting needs adjustment:
1. Use [Edit Cards](/docs/cards-list/editing/) to fix individual cards
2. Or [Export](/docs/sync-export-import/export-cards/), edit in Excel, re-import
3. Or set up [Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for ongoing edits

---

### Organize Imported Deck

1. **Rename deck** (if default name isn't good)
2. **Move to folder** (organize with other decks)
3. **Reorder cards** (see [Reordering](/docs/cards-list/reordering/))
4. **Start studying!**

---

## Import vs. Sync

| Feature | Import | Sync |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Creates new deck** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **One-time operation** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Ongoing bi-directional updates** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Preserves learning progress** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Auto-sync option** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Use Import for:** Creating new decks from files

**Use Sync for:** Ongoing editing workflow (see [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/))

## Troubleshooting

### Import Failed - "Invalid File Format"

**Causes:**
- File doesn't have "Term" and "Definition" columns
- Header row is missing
- File is corrupted

**Solutions:**
1. Open file in Excel to verify structure
2. Ensure first row has headers: `Term`, `Definition`
3. Check for special characters in headers
4. Try re-saving as .xlsx or .csv

---

### Import Failed - "No Cards Found"

**Causes:**
- File is empty (only header row)
- All rows after header are empty
- Columns are in wrong order

**Solutions:**
1. Verify file has data rows (not just header)
2. Check columns are named exactly "Term" and "Definition"
3. Remove any completely empty rows

---

### Cards Imported But Look Wrong

**Problems:**
- Text is cut off
- Formatting is missing
- Special characters show as "?" or boxes

**Solutions:**
1. **HTML formatting:** Ensure HTML tags are intact in Excel
2. **Encoding:** Save CSV with UTF-8 encoding
3. **Special characters:** Use Excel (.xlsx) instead of CSV for better support

---

### Duplicate Deck Created

**Problem:** Import created new deck instead of adding to existing

**Explanation:** Import always creates a new deck.

**Solutions:**
- Use [Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) to update existing deck
- Or use [Multi-Select](/docs/cards-list/multi-select/) to move cards between decks
- Or delete duplicate and re-import differently

---

## Tips for Successful Import

### Test With Small File First

**Before importing 1000 cards:**
1. Create test file with 5 cards
2. Import to GoCards
3. Verify formatting, encoding, structure
4. Then import your full file

---

### Use Excel Over CSV

**Excel (.xlsx) advantages:**
- Less prone to formatting errors
- Better handles special characters
- Easier to edit
- More forgiving of content with commas

---

### Name Files Descriptively

**Good filenames:**
- `Spanish-Vocabulary-Level1.xlsx`
- `Biology-Final-Exam.csv`

**Bad filenames:**
- `cards.xlsx` (too generic)
- `deck1.csv` (not descriptive)

**Why:** Imported deck name comes from filename

---

### Prepare File on Computer

**Don't:**
- Create file on phone (tiny keyboard, formatting issues)

**Do:**
- Use computer with Excel/Google Sheets
- Leverage formulas, find-replace, bulk editing
- Transfer finished file to phone
