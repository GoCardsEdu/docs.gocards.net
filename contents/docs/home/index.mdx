## Tips for Organization

- **Use folders by topic** - Group decks by subject, class, or project
- **Keep folder names short** - Easier to navigate on mobile
- **Recent Decks tab** - Your most-used decks are always one tap away
- **Export regularly** - Back up important decks (see [Database Backup](/docs/home/database-backup/))
- **Search is fast** - Don't over-organize; search works great for finding decks
