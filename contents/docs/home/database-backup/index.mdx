## Exporting Your Database

### Export Everything (All Decks)

From the home screen:

1. **Go to "All Decks" or "Recent Decks" tab**
2. **Tap "⋮" menu** (top-right)
3. **Select "Import Database"** (shows both import and export options)
4. **Choose "Export Database"**
5. **Select save location** (Downloads, Google Drive, etc.)
6. **File is saved** as `GoCards-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.db`

### Export a Single Deck

From any deck menu:

1. **Tap on a deck** to open menu
2. **Select "More" (⋮)**
3. **Choose "Export Database"**
4. **Select save location**
5. **File is saved** as `DeckName-YYYY-MM-DD.db`

The exported `.db` file contains:
- All cards in the deck/database
- Card term and definition content
- Learning progress (review intervals, memorization status)
- Study statistics
- Deck settings

## Importing a Database

### Before You Import

**⚠️ Warning:** Importing a database will:
- Add all decks/cards from the file
- If a deck with the same name exists, it may be **replaced or merged**
- Consider exporting your current database first as a backup

### Import Process

1. **Go to home screen** (Recent Decks or All Decks tab)
2. **Tap "⋮" menu** (top-right)
3. **Select "Import Database"**
4. **Browse to your .db file**
5. **Select the file**
6. **GoCards imports the data** (may take a few moments for large files)
7. **Your decks appear** in the All Decks list

### What Gets Imported

When you import a `.db` file:
- ✅ All decks and folders
- ✅ All cards with terms and definitions
- ✅ Learning progress and study history
- ✅ Card ordinal (card order)
- ✅ Deck settings
- ✅ Disabled card status
- ✅ HTML formatting in cards

## Best Practices

### Regular Backups

- **Weekly exports** if you study daily
- **After major edits** like importing or bulk changes
- **Before app updates** (just in case)
- **Before device changes** or factory resets

### Storage Locations

**Good places to save backups:**
- **Google Drive** - Automatic cloud backup
- **Dropbox** - Sync across devices
- **Local Downloads** - Then manually copy to computer
- **Email to yourself** - Quick and easy for small databases

**Avoid:**
- Temporary folders (may be auto-deleted)
- App cache directories

### File Naming

The app uses this format: `GoCards-backup-2025-12-29.db`

Consider adding details for multiple backups:
- `GoCards-backup-before-finals-2025-12-29.db`
- `Spanish-Deck-semester1-2025-12-29.db`

### Database File Size

Database files grow with:
- Number of cards
- HTML content (especially images)
- Study history length

Expect:
- Small deck (100 cards) = ~50 KB
- Medium deck (1000 cards) = ~500 KB
- Large deck (10,000 cards) = ~5 MB

## Transferring to a New Device

Moving to a new phone? Here's how:

### Method 1: Cloud Storage (Recommended)

1. **Old device:** Export database to Google Drive/Dropbox
2. **New device:** Install GoCards
3. **New device:** Import database from cloud storage
4. ✅ Done! All decks and progress transferred

### Method 2: Direct Transfer

1. **Old device:** Export database
2. **Transfer file** via USB, Bluetooth, or email
3. **New device:** Save file locally
4. **New device:** Import database

## Troubleshooting

### Import Failed

**Possible causes:**
- File is corrupted
- File is not a valid GoCards database
- Insufficient storage space
- File is from a newer version of GoCards

**Solutions:**
- Verify the file extension is `.db`
- Try re-exporting from the source
- Update GoCards to latest version
- Check available device storage

### Database Too Large

**If import times out or fails:**
- Split your content into smaller decks first
- Remove unused decks before exporting
- Export individual decks instead of entire database

### Lost Progress After Import

**If study progress is missing:**
- Make sure you imported the correct file
- Check if the import completed successfully
- The file may have been exported before your recent study sessions
