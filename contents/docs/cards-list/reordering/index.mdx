Reorder your flashcards to create the perfect learning sequence. GoCards supports intuitive drag-and-drop reordering in the Cards List.

## How to Reorder Cards

### Drag-and-Drop Method

1. **Open "List Cards"** for your deck
2. **Long-press a card** (hold for ~1 second)
3. **Drag the card** up or down
4. **Release** at the desired position
5. **Cards renumber automatically**

The card slides into its new position, and all other cards adjust their numbers accordingly.

## Why Reorder Cards?

### Logical Progression

**Before exam:** Order by chapter/topic sequence
- Chapter 1 concepts first
- Chapter 2 concepts next
- Follows your textbook or course

### Difficulty Gradient

**For beginners:** Easy → Hard
- Build confidence with simple cards
- Gradually increase complexity
- Momentum helps learning

**For review:** Hard → Easy
- Tackle difficult material first
- Get tough cards out of the way
- End on a positive note

### Related Content Grouping

**Keep similar cards together:**
- All vocabulary cards in one section
- All formulas in another section
- All historical dates grouped
- Easier to build connections

### Random Order

**Avoid pattern memorization:**
- Shuffle cards to prevent position-based recall
- Test true understanding
- Useful before exams

## Reordering Best Practices

### When to Reorder

**✅ Good times:**
- After importing a new deck (establish structure)
- Before starting to study (set up sequence)
- During deck review (reorganize as you learn)
- Before exams (prioritize important cards)

**❌ Avoid:**
- During active study sessions (breaks focus)
- Too frequently (pick a structure and stick with it)

### Efficient Reordering

**For small adjustments (1-5 cards):**
- Use drag-and-drop in GoCards
- Quick and intuitive

**For major reorganization (10+ cards):**
- Export to Excel/CSV (Premium)
- Reorder rows in Excel (faster)
- Sync back to GoCards

## Card Numbers and Position

### Understanding Ordinal Numbers

Each card has a position number (1, 2, 3, ...):

**Before reordering:**
```
1. What is DNA?
2. What is RNA?
3. What is ATP?
```

**Move card 3 to position 1:**
```
1. What is ATP?      ← Moved here
2. What is DNA?      ← Was 1, now 2
3. What is RNA?      ← Was 2, now 3
```

**All cards automatically renumber** - no manual updating needed.

### Position Affects Study Order

**New cards** appear in study mode following this order:
- Card 1 shown first
- Card 2 shown second
- Card 3 shown third
- And so on...

**Review cards** (already studied) appear based on:
- Due date (spaced repetition algorithm)
- Position is secondary factor

**Tip:** Reordering mostly affects new cards and browse mode.

## Advanced Reordering Techniques

### Move to Top

**Scenario:** Card 47 is very important

**Method:**
1. Long-press card 47
2. Drag all the way to top
3. Release
4. Now it's card 1

### Move to Bottom

**Scenario:** Card 5 isn't relevant yet

**Method:**
1. Long-press card 5
2. Drag all the way to bottom
3. Release
4. Now it's the last card

### Insert Between Cards

**Scenario:** Card 10 fits better between 3 and 4

**Method:**
1. Long-press card 10
2. Drag to space between cards 3 and 4
3. Release
4. Cards renumber: old 10 → new 4, old 4+ all shift down

## Reordering Large Decks

### Challenge: Dragging card 200 to position 5

**Problem:** Long drag distance is tedious

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Use Search

1. Search for the card
2. Drag it to new position in filtered view
3. Clear search - card is now reordered

#### Option 2: Multi-Step Dragging

1. Drag card 200 to card 100 (first move)
2. Drag card 100 to card 50 (second move)
3. Drag card 50 to card 5 (final move)

#### Option 3: Excel Reordering (Premium)

1. Export deck to Excel
2. Cut row 200
3. Insert at row 5
4. Save and sync
5. Much faster for major changes

## Reordering and File Sync

### How Sync Handles Reordering

**If you reorder in GoCards:**
- Next sync updates Excel file row order
- Cards move to match GoCards sequence

**If you reorder in Excel:**
- Next sync updates GoCards card order
- Cards move to match Excel sequence

**Conflict resolution:**
- Newest change wins (based on timestamps)
- GoCards compares last modified dates

See [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for details.

## Tips for Organizing Your Deck

### Create Sections

**Example: Language Deck**
```
Cards 1-50:   Greetings & Basic Phrases
Cards 51-100: Food & Restaurants
Cards 101-150: Travel & Directions
Cards 151-200: Work & Business
```

**How:**
- Reorder cards to group by theme
- Consider adding "header cards" with just section names

### Alphabetical Order

**For reference decks:**
- Order terms alphabetically
- Easy to find specific cards
- Good for dictionaries, glossaries

**How:**
1. Export to Excel
2. Sort by "Term" column
3. Sync back

### By Difficulty

**Rate your cards:**
- Green cards (easy) → Beginning
- Yellow cards (medium) → Middle
- Red cards (hard) → End

**Benefit:** Focus energy where needed

### By Exam Weight

**Before finals:**
- High-value topics first
- Less important topics last
- Prioritize study time effectively

## Reordering vs. Other Organization Methods

| Goal | Best Method |
|------|-------------|
| Change study sequence | Reorder cards |
| Group by topic | Reorder OR use folders/separate decks |
| Remove cards | Delete instead |
| Temporarily skip cards | Disable card (if available) |
| Major reorganization | Export to Excel, reorder, sync |

---

## Limitations

### Can't Reorder Across Decks

Each deck has its own sequence. To move cards between decks:

1. Use [Multi-Select](/docs/cards-list/multi-select/) to cut cards
2. Open destination deck
3. Paste cards

### Reordering Doesn't Affect Review Schedule

**Doesn't change:**
- Next review date
- Learning intervals
- Spaced repetition algorithm

**Only changes:**
- Card display order
- New card presentation sequence

### No "Shuffle" Button

To randomize cards:
- Export to Excel
- Use Excel's RAND() function to randomize
- Sync back

Or manually drag cards to different positions.
