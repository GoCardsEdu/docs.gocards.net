## Understanding Card Numbers

Each card has an **ordinal number** (1, 2, 3, ...) showing its position:

### Position Matters
- **Study mode** shows cards in this order (for new cards)
- **Browse mode** follows this sequence
- **Export to Excel/CSV** preserves this order

### Changing Numbers
- **Reorder cards** - Numbers update automatically
- **Delete a card** - Subsequent cards renumber
- **Add a card** - Gets next available number (or inserted position)

### Tips
- **Group related cards** - Keep similar topics together
- **Difficulty progression** - Easy → Hard or vice versa
- **Logical sequence** - Follow a learning path

## Edge Bar Details

### Left vs. Right Edge Bar

Configurable in [App Settings](/docs/settings/app-settings/):
- **Show left edge bar** - Status appears on left side
- **Show right edge bar** - Status appears on right side
- **Show both** - Redundant but highly visible
- **Hide both** - Clean interface, no status indicators

### Status Priority

If a card has multiple statuses, the edge bar shows:
1. **Sync status** (if recently synced) - Orange/Green
2. **Forgotten status** (if marked "Again") - Red
3. **Learning status** (if being studied) - Yellow/Green
4. **Disabled status** (if disabled) - Gray

### After Syncing

Edge bars help you see what changed:

**Scenario:** You edited 5 cards in Excel and synced.

**In Cards List:**
- 5 cards have **bright orange edge bars** (updated from file)
- Other cards unchanged

This visual feedback confirms sync worked correctly.

## Tips for Managing Large Decks

### Use Search Extensively
- Don't scroll through 500 cards
- Search for what you need
- Much faster than visual scanning

### Regular Maintenance
- Delete duplicate cards
- Fix typos as you find them
- Keep definitions concise

### Organize Before Import
- Structure your Excel/CSV file well
- Cards import in the order they appear
- Easier to organize in spreadsheet software

### Monitor Edge Bars
- Forgotten cards (red) need attention
- Consider editing to make clearer
- Or study more frequently

### Disable Instead of Delete
- Card not relevant now but might be later?
- Disable it (won't show in study mode)
- Re-enable when needed

*(Note: Disable feature may require specific implementation - check if available)*

## Common Workflows

### Review and Edit New Cards

After bulk import:

1. Open **Cards List**
2. Scroll through cards
3. Tap any card to edit
4. Fix formatting, typos, clarity
5. Repeat until satisfied

### Find and Fix Duplicates

1. **Search for common terms**
2. If you see duplicates, decide which to keep
3. **Edit one** to merge information
4. **Delete the other**

### Reorganize Deck Structure

1. Decide on logical order (alphabetical, difficulty, topic)
2. **Long-press and drag** cards to reorder (see [Reordering](/docs/cards-list/reordering/))
3. Save time by organizing in Excel first, then syncing

### Prepare for Exam

1. **Search for relevant topics** (e.g., "Chapter 5")
2. **Review those cards** in Browse Mode or study them
3. **Edit** any confusing cards for clarity
4. **Study mode** to drill the deck
