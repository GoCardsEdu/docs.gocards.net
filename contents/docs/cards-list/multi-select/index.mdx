## Tips for Efficient Multi-Select

### Use Search First

**Before multi-selecting:**
1. **Search to filter** cards you want to select
2. **Enter multi-select mode**
3. **Select from filtered results** (faster than scrolling through entire deck)

### Check Selection Count

**Selection counter** (e.g., "12 cards selected") helps verify:
- You selected the right number
- You didn't miss any cards
- You didn't over-select

### Preview Before Pasting

**After cutting but before pasting:**
- **Navigate to destination**
- **Verify it's the right location**
- **Then paste**
- Can't undo paste easily

### Backup Before Major Moves

Before moving 50+ cards:
1. **Export database** as backup
2. **Perform multi-select operations**
3. **If something goes wrong:** Restore from backup

## Limitations

### Can't Partially Edit

Multi-select is for moving/deleting, not editing:
- ❌ Can't bulk-edit selected cards' content
- ❌ Can't apply formatting to multiple cards at once
- ✅ For bulk edits, use [Excel/CSV Export](/docs/sync-export-import/export-cards/), edit in Excel, re-import

### Selection Doesn't Persist

**If you exit multi-select mode:**
- Selection clears
- Have to re-select cards if you return
- Complete your operation before exiting

### Cut/Paste is Deck-Specific

**Can only cut/paste within or between decks:**
- ❌ Can't cut from one GoCards database and paste to another device
- ✅ Use [Export/Import Database](/docs/home/database-backup/) for cross-device transfers

---

## Multi-Select and File Sync

### Syncing After Multi-Select Operations

**If auto-sync enabled:**
- Moved cards update in Excel file on next sync
- Rows reorder to match GoCards
- Deleted cards removed from Excel

**If manual sync:**
- Changes don't sync until you trigger sync
- Excel file unchanged until then

### Conflicts

**Scenario:** You cut/paste cards in GoCards, but Excel file was edited with different card orders.

**Resolution:**
- Newest change wins (based on last modified timestamp)
- GoCards compares modification dates
- Usually GoCards changes persist if done after Excel edits

See [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for conflict details.
