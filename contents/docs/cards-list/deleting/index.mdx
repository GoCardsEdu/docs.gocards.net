## Undo Deletion

## What Happens When You Delete

### Immediate Effects

- ✅ Card removed from deck
- ✅ Card number/ordinal removed
- ✅ Subsequent cards renumber (e.g., card 11 becomes card 10)
- ✅ Card won't appear in study mode anymore
- ✅ Card won't appear in browse mode
- ✅ Card won't appear in cards list

### Learning Progress

- ❌ **Study history lost** - All grading button clicks gone
- ❌ **Review schedule deleted** - Won't appear in future study sessions
- ❌ **Statistics affected** - Total card count decreases

**Deletion is permanent** (unless you undo immediately or restore from backup)

---

## Bulk Deletion

### Delete Multiple Cards

**Use Multi-Select:**

1. **Tap a card** → **"Select Card"**
2. **Tap additional cards** to select them
3. **Tap "Delete" action** (in selection menu)
4. **Confirm bulk deletion**
5. **All selected cards removed**

See [Multi-Select Operations](/docs/cards-list/multi-select/) for details.

## Common Deletion Scenarios

### Remove Duplicate Cards

**Problem:** Accidentally imported same cards twice

**Solution:**
1. **Use search** to find duplicates (search for common terms)
2. **Swipe to delete** extra copies
3. **Keep the best version** (most complete, best formatted)

---

### Clean Up After Import

**Problem:** Imported deck has irrelevant cards

**Solution:**
1. **Browse or list all cards**
2. **Swipe away** cards you don't need
3. **Or use search** to find all cards on unwanted topics, then bulk delete

---

### Remove Mastered Cards

**Problem:** You've truly mastered some cards forever

**Consideration:** Keep them! They reinforce knowledge.

**If you insist on deleting:**
1. Filter/search for cards with long intervals (well-learned)
2. Delete individually or use multi-select
3. **Warning:** You'll lose the satisfaction of seeing "10,000 cards mastered"

**Better alternative:** Just let them sit. They'll review every few months automatically.

---

### Delete Empty/Test Cards

**Problem:** Created test cards or placeholders

**Solution:**
1. **Search for empty content** (search for "test" or "placeholder")
2. **Swipe to delete** each one
3. **Or multi-select** and bulk delete

---

## Deletion vs. Alternatives

### Should You Delete?

**Delete if:**
- ✅ Card is completely wrong
- ✅ Card is a duplicate
- ✅ Card is irrelevant to your goals
- ✅ Card is outdated (date-based info changed)

**Don't delete if:**
- ❌ Card is just difficult (study more instead)
- ❌ Card has minor typos (edit instead - see [Editing](/docs/cards-list/editing/))
- ❌ Card is temporarily irrelevant (consider disabling if available)
- ❌ You might need it later (keep it, low cost)

### Alternatives to Deletion

| Goal | Instead of Deleting | Method |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Fix wrong info | Edit the card | [Editing Guide](/docs/cards-list/editing/) |
| Skip card temporarily | Disable card (if available) | Deck settings |
| Remove from current deck | Move to another deck | Multi-select → Cut → Paste |
| Archive old cards | Create "Archive" folder/deck | Move cards there |

## Recovering Deleted Cards

### Option 1: Undo Immediately

- **Within 3 seconds** of swipe deletion
- **Tap "Undo"** prompt
- **Or use ↶ undo button** in study mode

### Option 2: Restore from Backup

If you have a [database backup](/docs/home/database-backup/):

1. **Find your most recent backup** (.db file)
2. **Import the database** (⚠️ this replaces your entire current database)
3. **Deleted cards are restored**
4. **Warning:** You'll lose any changes made since the backup

**Lesson:** Regular backups are essential!

### Option 3: Restore from Synced File (Premium)

If using [File Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/):

1. **Open your Excel/CSV file**
2. **Deleted card still there** (if you deleted in app after last sync)
3. **Sync file to GoCards**
4. **Card restores automatically**

**Only works if:** You deleted in GoCards but the card still exists in the file.

### Option 4: Re-import

If you imported the card originally:

1. **Find the original source** (Excel file, another deck, etc.)
2. **Re-import the card** or manually recreate it
3. **⚠️ Learning progress lost** - It's a "new" card again

## Tips for Safe Deletion

### Be Careful with Swipe

**Swipe-to-delete is fast** - maybe too fast!

- **Slow down** when scrolling near cards you want to keep
- **Horizontal swipes** delete, **vertical scrolls** navigate
- **Watch for undo prompt** after every swipe deletion

### Confirm Before Bulk Delete

When deleting multiple cards:
- **Double-check selection** - Make sure you selected the right cards
- **Read confirmation dialog** carefully
- **No undo for bulk operations** (usually)

### Backup Before Major Cleanup

Before deleting many cards:

1. **Export database** as backup
2. **Perform deletions**
3. **If you messed up:** Restore from backup

### Use Search to Verify

Before deleting based on search:

1. **Search for cards** (e.g., "Chapter 1")
2. **Review ALL results** - Make sure they're all deletion candidates
3. **Select and delete**

## Deletion and File Sync

### Deleting in GoCards

**If auto-sync enabled:**
- Deleted cards removed from Excel file on next sync
- Corresponding rows deleted
- **Sync preserves other columns** in Excel (if any)

**If manual sync:**
- Deleted cards remain in Excel until you sync
- Next sync removes them from file

### Deleting in Excel

**If you delete a row in Excel:**
- Next sync removes that card from GoCards
- Card disappears from deck
- **Learning progress lost**

### Conflict Resolution

**Scenario:** Card deleted in GoCards, but updated in Excel (both happened since last sync)

**Result:** Depends on timestamp:
- If Excel file is newer → Card restored to GoCards
- If GoCards is newer → Card removed from Excel

See [Sync Cards - Conflict Resolution](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/#conflict-resolution) for details.
