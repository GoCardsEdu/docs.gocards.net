## Editing the Term (Front)

The **term** is the question or prompt shown first during study.

### Best Practices

**✅ Good terms:**
- "What is photosynthesis?"
- "Capital of France"
- "Define: Mitosis"
- "How do you say 'hello' in Spanish?"

**❌ Avoid:**
- Empty terms
- Overly long paragraphs (split into multiple cards)
- Ambiguous questions ("What is it?" - what is "it"?)

### HTML Support

Terms support basic HTML:
- `<b>Bold text</b>`
- `<i>Italic text</i>`
- `<img src="url">` for images

See [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/) for details.

---

## Editing the Definition (Back)

The **definition** is the answer revealed during study.

### Best Practices

**✅ Good definitions:**
- Concise and accurate
- One main concept per card
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include examples if helpful

**❌ Avoid:**
- Overly verbose explanations (use multiple cards instead)
- Irrelevant information
- Ambiguous answers

### Rich Content

Definitions support:
- **HTML formatting** (bold, italic, lists, images)
- **Multi-line text** (use Enter/Return)
- **Special characters** (emoji, symbols: ©, ™, °, etc.)
- **URLs** (clickable links in study mode)

---

## Saving Changes

### Save Methods

1. **Tap 💾 save icon** (top-right) - Most reliable
2. **Back button** - May prompt to save changes
3. **Auto-save** - *(Feature may vary by version)*

### What Happens When You Save

- Card content updates immediately
- **Learning progress preserved** - Review intervals unchanged
- **Position in deck unchanged** - Ordinal number stays same
- **Last modified date updated** - Visible for sync tracking
- **Edge bar may update** - If sync status changes

---

## Does Editing Affect Learning Progress?

**Short answer:** No, editing is safe!

### What's Preserved

✅ **Review interval** - Next review date unchanged
✅ **Learning history** - Past grading buttons still count
✅ **Memorization status** - Card still marked as learned/forgotten
✅ **Study statistics** - Total reviews, success rate, etc.

### What Changes

⚠️ **Last modified timestamp** - Used for file sync
⚠️ **Sync status** - Edge bar may show "updated" after next sync

### Example

**Before edit:**
- Card: "What is H2O?" → "Water"
- Next review: 10 days from now
- Study history: Marked "Easy" 3 times

**Edit card:**
- Change to: "What is the chemical formula for water?" → "H2O"

**After edit:**
- **Next review still:** 10 days from now
- **Study history:** Still shows 3 "Easy" grades
- **Behavior:** Spaced repetition continues normally

## Common Editing Scenarios

### Fix a Typo

**Problem:** "Whatt is photosynthesis?" (extra 't')

**Solution:**
1. Tap card → Edit Card
2. Fix: "What is photosynthesis?"
3. Save
4. Done in 5 seconds

---

### Add More Information

**Problem:** Definition is too vague

**Original:**
- Term: "Mitosis"
- Definition: "Cell division"

**Improved:**
- Term: "Mitosis"
- Definition: "Cell division where one cell divides into two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes"

**How:**
1. Edit card
2. Expand definition
3. Save

---

### Clarify Ambiguity

**Problem:** Card is confusing

**Original:**
- Term: "The capital"
- Definition: "Paris"

**Improved:**
- Term: "What is the capital of France?"
- Definition: "Paris"

**Why:** Clearer question, easier to remember

---

### Split a Complex Card

**Problem:** Card tries to teach too much

**Original:**
- Term: "Explain photosynthesis"
- Definition: "Photosynthesis is when plants convert light energy to chemical energy, using chlorophyll in chloroplasts, taking in CO2 and water, producing glucose and oxygen, happening in two stages: light-dependent and light-independent reactions..."

**Better:** Split into 4 cards:
1. "What is photosynthesis?" → "Process where plants convert light energy to chemical energy"
2. "What molecule is used in photosynthesis?" → "Chlorophyll"
3. "What are the inputs of photosynthesis?" → "CO2, water, light"
4. "What are the outputs of photosynthesis?" → "Glucose, oxygen"

**How:**
1. Edit original card (simplify)
2. Add 3 new cards
3. Each card = one concept

---

### Add an Image

**Problem:** Text alone isn't enough

**How:**
1. Edit card
2. Add HTML: `<img src="https://example.com/diagram.png">`
3. Save

See [Formatting Cards](/docs/cards-list/formatting/) for image details.

## Bulk Editing

Need to edit many cards? Two approaches:

### Option 1: Edit in GoCards

**Pros:** Direct, immediate
**Cons:** Tedious for many cards
**Best for:** 1-10 cards

**Process:**
1. Open Cards List
2. Edit each card one by one
3. Save after each

### Option 2: Export, Edit in Excel, Re-sync (Premium)

**Pros:** Fast for bulk changes, powerful editing tools
**Cons:** Requires Premium, extra steps
**Best for:** 10+ cards

**Process:**
1. Export deck to Excel/CSV
2. Edit in Excel (use find-replace, formulas, etc.)
3. Save Excel file
4. Sync back to GoCards

See [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for details.

---

## Undo Edits

### Immediate Undo

If you just saved and regret it:

1. **Tap the card again** → Edit Card
2. **Re-type the original content** (if you remember)
3. **Save**

Unfortunately, there's no built-in "undo edit" button.

### Restore from Backup

If you have a [database backup](/docs/home/database-backup/):

1. **Export current database** (safety backup)
2. **Import old database** (from before the edit)
3. **Find the card** - original content restored

**Warning:** This restores the entire database, losing any other changes made since the backup.

## Tips for Effective Editing

### Edit While Studying

When a card confuses you during study:
- **Pause and edit it immediately**
- Fix the confusion for next time
- Your future self will thank you

### Use Consistent Formatting

- **Terms:** Always phrased as questions? Always single words? Be consistent
- **Definitions:** Same structure across deck (e.g., always start with category)

### Keep It Simple

- **Shorter is better** - Easier to remember
- **One fact per card** - Don't overload
- **Clear language** - Avoid jargon unless necessary

### Review Before Exams

- **Edit outdated information** (dates, facts)
- **Clarify confusing cards** you struggled with
- **Add related info** that appeared in lectures

### Track Sync Changes

If using [File Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/):
- Edits in GoCards sync back to Excel
- Check edge bars to see which cards changed
- Excel "Last Modified" column shows GoCards edits
