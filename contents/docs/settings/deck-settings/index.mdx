Deck Settings let you configure options for a specific deck without affecting other decks.

## How to Access

1. **Tap on a deck** → **"More"** → **"Deck Settings"**
2. Or **"List Cards"** → **"⋮" menu** → **"Deck Settings"** (gear icon)

Opens Settings screen on **"This Deck" tab**.

## Available Settings

### Auto-Sync (Premium)

**What it does:** Automatically syncs deck with linked Excel/CSV file when opening or closing the deck.

**Options:**
- ON - Auto-sync enabled
- OFF - Manual sync only

**When to use:**
- ON: Regularly editing cards in Excel on computer
- OFF: Deck is stable, no external edits

**Prerequisites:**
- Premium subscription
- Deck linked to a file (More → "Sync with file")

See [Sync Cards](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for details.

### Limit Forgotten Cards

**What it does:** Controls how many "Again" cards can stack up during a study session.

**Default:** 5 cards

**How it works:**
- When you mark a card "Again", it stays in current session
- After forgetting 5 cards (or your limit), additional "Again" cards wait until next session
- Prevents endless loops of difficult cards

**Recommended values:**
- **3-5:** Short, focused sessions (10-15 min)
- **10:** Medium sessions (20-30 min)
- **20+:** Long, intensive sessions
- **Unlimited (999):** Review all cards regardless

**When to adjust:**
- **Increase:** If sessions end too quickly
- **Decrease:** If overwhelmed by difficult cards

### Max Lines (Card List Display)

**What it does:** Limits how many lines of text show per card in the list view.

**Default:** 3 lines

**Options:** 1-10 lines

**Effect:**
- **Low (1-2):** Compact list, see more cards on screen
- **Medium (3-4):** Balanced view
- **High (5-10):** See more content per card, less scrolling

**When to adjust:**
- **Decrease:** Deck has many short cards, want to see more at once
- **Increase:** Long definitions, want to read more without tapping

**Note:** Study mode always shows full text (this only affects list view).

## Settings Inheritance

Deck settings override "All Decks" defaults:

**Example:**
- **All Decks:** Limit forgotten cards = 10
- **This Deck:** Limit forgotten cards = 5
- **Result:** This deck uses 5 (deck setting wins)

**Leave blank/default:** Deck inherits from "All Decks" settings.

## Tips

### Start with Defaults
- Don't over-customize initially
- Study a few sessions first
- Adjust based on experience

### Per-Deck Customization
- **Easy deck:** Higher forgotten card limit (study more)
- **Hard deck:** Lower limit (prevent frustration)
- **Synced deck:** Auto-sync ON
- **Static deck:** Auto-sync OFF (save battery/data)

### Test Changes
- Adjust one setting at a time
- Study a session to feel the difference
- Fine-tune as needed
