App Settings control global preferences that apply across all decks and the entire app.

## How to Access

**Home screen** → **"⋮" menu** (top-right) → **"App Settings"**

Opens Settings screen with 3 tabs. This page covers tabs 2 and 3.

## Tab 2: All Decks (Defaults)

Settings that apply to **all decks by default**. Individual decks can override these in their deck settings.

### Limit Forgotten Cards

**What it does:** Default forgotten card limit for all new decks.

**Default:** 5 cards

**How it works:**
- When creating a new deck, it inherits this value
- Existing decks keep their current settings
- Individual decks can override this

See [Deck Settings](/docs/settings/deck-settings/) for details on this setting.

---

### Max Lines

**What it does:** Default card display lines for all decks in list view.

**Default:** 3 lines

**Options:** 1-10 lines

**Effect:**
- Applies to all decks that don't have custom max lines set
- See [Deck Settings](/docs/settings/deck-settings/) for details

---

### Show Left Edge Bar

**What it does:** Displays status indicator on left side of cards in list view.

**Default:** ON

**Edge bar shows:**
- 🔴 Red - Forgotten cards
- 🟡 Yellow - Learning in progress
- 🟢 Green - Well-memorized
- 🟠 Orange - Updated via sync
- 🟢 Bright green - Added via sync

**When to disable:**
- Prefer clean, minimalist interface
- Don't need visual status indicators
- Screen space is limited

---

### Show Right Edge Bar

**What it does:** Displays status indicator on right side of cards in list view.

**Default:** OFF

**Options:**
- ON - Shows edge bar on right
- OFF - No right edge bar

**When to enable:**
- Want redundant status indicators (same info as left bar)
- Prefer status on right side
- Left-handed users may find it more natural

**Note:** Most users only need one edge bar (left or right, not both).

---

## Tab 3: App (Global Settings)

Settings that affect the entire app, not specific to decks.

### Dark Mode

**What it does:** Changes app color scheme.

**Options:**
- **Auto** (Default) - Follows Android system dark mode setting
- **Light** - Always light theme
- **Dark** - Always dark theme

**Benefits of dark mode:**
- Easier on eyes in low light
- Saves battery (on OLED screens)
- Reduces glare

**When to use:**
- **Auto:** Let Android handle it (switches based on time/ambient light)
- **Light:** Always prefer light theme regardless of time
- **Dark:** Always prefer dark theme

**Effect:**
- Changes background colors throughout app
- Text colors adjust automatically
- Applies immediately

## Tips

### Minimize Visual Clutter

**For clean interface:**
1. Disable right edge bar (keep left only)
2. Lower max lines (2-3)
3. Use dark mode (less harsh)

### Maximize Information

**To see more at once:**
1. Enable both edge bars (redundant but visible)
2. Increase max lines (5-7)
3. Light mode (higher contrast)

### Battery Saving

**Optimize for battery life:**
1. Dark mode ON (especially on OLED screens)
2. Disable auto-sync (sync manually)
3. Lower max lines (less rendering)

### New User Defaults

**Recommended starting settings:**
- Dark Mode: Auto
- Show left edge bar: ON
- Show right edge bar: OFF
- Limit forgotten cards: 5
- Max lines: 3

Study with these for a week, then customize based on preference.

### After Changing Settings

**Take effect immediately:**
- Dark mode
- Edge bar visibility

**Take effect next time:**
- Max lines (next time you open list view)
- Forgotten card limits (next study session)
