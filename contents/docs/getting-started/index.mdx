Welcome to GoCards! This guide will walk you through creating your first deck and starting your learning journey.

## Your First Time Opening GoCards

When you open GoCards, you'll see the home screen with **4 tabs** at the bottom:
- **Recent Decks** (⏱️) - Shows your recently accessed decks
- **All Decks** (📊) - Browse all decks and folders
- **Explore** (🌐) - Community features (coming soon)
- **Discover** (📰) - Premium features and updates

Let's start in the **All Decks** tab.

## Step 1: Create Your First Deck

1. **Tap the "All Decks" tab** at the bottom
2. **Tap the "+" button** in the bottom-right corner
3. **Enter a name** for your deck (e.g., "Spanish Vocabulary", "Biology Terms")
4. **Tap "Create"**

Your new deck now appears in the list!

## Step 2: Add Your First Cards

1. **Tap on your deck** to open the deck menu
2. **Select "List Cards"**
3. **Tap the "+" button** in the top-right
4. **Enter the Term** (the question - front of the card)
5. **Enter the Definition** (the answer - back of the card)
6. **Tap the save icon** (💾)

Repeat to add more cards. We recommend starting with at least 5-10 cards.

### Quick Tips for Creating Cards
- Keep both term and definition concise
- One concept per card works best
- Don't worry about order - you can reorder them later by dragging

## Step 3: Study Your Cards

Now it's time to learn!

1. **Go back** to your deck (tap the back arrow)
2. **Tap on the deck** again
3. **Select "Study Cards"**

### Your First Study Session

The study screen shows:
- **Term** at the top (the question)
- **Tap the bottom section** to reveal the definition (answer)
- **Swipe left or right** to navigate between cards

After revealing the answer, **grade yourself** with one of four buttons:

| Button | When to Use | Next Review |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Again** (Red) | You forgot | Soon (stays in current session) |
| **Quick** (Orange) | For cramming | 5 minutes |
| **Hard** (Blue) | Remembered with difficulty | 3 days |
| **Easy** (Green) | Remembered easily | 5 days |

Each button shows when you'll see the card again. The app uses **spaced repetition** to help you learn efficiently.

## Step 4: Explore More Features

You're now ready to use GoCards! Here are some next steps:

### Organize with Folders (Premium)
Create folders in the "All Decks" tab to group related decks.

### Browse Your Cards
Want to review cards without studying? Use "Browse Cards" from the deck menu for a view-only carousel.

### Customize Your Experience
- **Pinch to zoom** in study mode to adjust text size
- **Dark mode** available in App Settings
- **Edge bars** show card status (learning progress, sync status)

### Sync with Excel/CSV (Premium)
Edit cards on your computer and automatically sync them to your phone - without losing study progress!
