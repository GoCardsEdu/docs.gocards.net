## Why Sync Instead of Import?

**The Problem with Traditional Apps:**

Most flashcard apps only support importing files. Every time you update your flashcards, you have to delete the old deck and import a new one, losing all your study progress in the process.

**The GoCards Solution:**

Sync your deck once, then edit the file anytime. Changes flow automatically in both directions while your learning statistics, due dates, and mastery levels stay intact.

## How Sync Works

GoCards uses smart synchronization that compares modification dates to determine which source has the newest changes.

### Intelligent Card Matching

When syncing, GoCards automatically detects whether a card has been modified or is entirely new:

- 🟠 **Modified cards** - Updated if there's at least 70% similarity in the term or definition (prevents accidental overwrites)
- 🟢 **New cards** - Added automatically if similarity is below 70%
- 🔴 **Deleted cards** - Removed if they no longer exist in the source

This smart matching ensures your edits are preserved while preventing duplicate cards.

### What Gets Synced

**When the file is newer than the deck:**
- 🟢 New cards from the file are added
- 🔴 Deleted cards are removed
- 🟠 Modified cards are updated
- Card order matches the file
- Study progress is preserved

**When the card is newer than the file:**
- 🟠 Changes from the card are written back to the file
- Custom columns in your spreadsheet are preserved and move with their cards

## See It in Action

Watch how sync works in practice:

**What happens in this demo:**
1. A deck is exported to create a synced file
2. Changes are made to both the file (3 cards) and the app (3 cards)
3. Sync is triggered
4. The card list shows what changed with color indicators
5. Study progress remains intact despite the updates

## Visual Sync Indicators

After syncing, colored edge bars in your card list show exactly which cards changed.
