## Available Settings

## Studying

### Limit Forgotten Cards

**What it does:** Controls how many "Again" cards can accumulate before reviewing them.

**How it works:**
- When you mark a card as "Again", it remains in the current session queue
- Once you reach the limit (default: 5 cards), the session loops back to review the first forgotten card
- This prevents you from progressing through all cards without reinforcing the ones you're struggling with

## Card List

### Max Lines

**What it does:** Limits the number of text lines displayed per card in list view.

**Note:** Study mode always shows the full card content—this setting only affects the card list view.
