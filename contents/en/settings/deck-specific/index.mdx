## How to Access

1. **Tap on a deck** → **"More"** → **"Deck Settings"**
2. Or **"List Cards"** → **"⋮" menu** → **"Deck Settings"** (gear icon)
Opens Settings screen on **"This Deck" tab**.

"This Deck" settings override "All Decks" defaults:

**Example:**
- **All Decks:** Limit forgotten cards = 10
- **This Deck:** Limit forgotten cards = 5
- **Result:** This deck uses 5 (deck setting wins)

**Leave blank/default:** Deck inherits from "All Decks" settings.

## Available Settings

### Auto-Sync (Premium feature)

**What it does:** Automatically syncs deck with linked Excel/CSV file when opening or closing the deck.

**Options:**
- ON - Auto-sync enabled
- OFF


See [Sync Cards](/en/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/) for details.

## Studying

### Limit Forgotten Cards

**What it does:** Controls how many "Again" cards can accumulate before reviewing them.

**How it works:**
- When you mark a card as "Again", it remains in the current session queue
- Once you reach the limit (default: 5 cards), the session loops back to review the first forgotten card
- This prevents you from progressing through all cards without reinforcing the ones you're struggling with

## Card List

### Max Lines

**What it does:** Limits the number of text lines displayed per card in list view.

**Note:** Study mode always shows the full card content—this setting only affects the card list view.
