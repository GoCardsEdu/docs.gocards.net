## What the AI Can Do

The AI Assistant is a chat panel available inside any deck. You can ask it to:

- **Create cards** — describe a topic and the AI generates term/definition pairs and adds them directly to your deck
- **Update cards** — ask to rephrase, expand, or correct existing cards
- **Delete cards** — remove cards by describing which ones to remove
- **Suggest improvements** — ask for feedback on card quality or coverage

The AI is aware of your deck name and existing cards, so it can infer the topic without extra instructions.

## How to Open the AI Assistant

1. Open any deck (tap it from the **Deck List**)
2. Tap the **AI floating button** in the bottom-right corner of the screen

The chat panel opens as a bottom sheet overlay — your card list stays visible behind it.

## Access Options

There are two ways to use the AI:

### Option 1 — Token Package (Gemini)

1. Tap **Login** inside the AI panel
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Tap **Buy Tokens** to purchase a package of tokens
4. Start chatting — tokens are deducted automatically per message

The token balance is shown at the top of the chat panel. You can buy additional packages any time your balance is low.

**Device requirements for purchasing:** The app must be installed from Google Play on a certified, non-rooted Android device with security updates within the last year. This is required by Google Play Integrity API to prevent fraud.

### Option 2 — Your Own OpenAI API Key (BYOK)

Use your own OpenAI account and API key — no login to GoCards required.

1. Go to **Settings** → **App Settings** → **OpenAI API Key**
2. Paste your OpenAI API key
3. Open the AI panel in any deck and start chatting

Charges are billed directly to your OpenAI account.
