To reorganize your deck structure:

1. **Open the "All Decks" tab** (cut is not available in Recent Decks)
2. **Tap "⋮" menu** on the deck or folder you want to move
3. **Tap "Cut"** — a paste toolbar appears at the bottom
4. **Navigate to the destination folder**
5. **Tap "Paste the deck here"** in the toolbar

The deck moves to the new location. The same process works for moving folders to different locations.
