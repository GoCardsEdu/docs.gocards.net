## Introduction

**GoCards**, **AnkiDroid**, and **Quizlet** are three popular flashcard apps on Android, but they take very different approaches to studying, card management, and user interaction.

This page compares them screen by screen so you can decide which app fits your learning style.

## Grading Buttons

All three apps let you rate your recall after revealing the answer, but the options differ significantly.

### GoCards: 4 Buttons

| Button | When to use | First review | Growth |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 🔴 **Again** | Forgot completely | 2 days | Stays in session, reappears after 5 cards |
| 🟠 **Quick Repetition** | Cramming / short-term recall | 5 minutes | Doubles each time (5 → 10 → 20 min) |
| 🔵 **Hard** | Remembered with effort | 3 days | interval × 1.5 |
| 🟢 **Easy** | Remembered quickly | 5 days | interval × 2 |

### AnkiDroid: 4 Buttons

| Button | When to use | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Again** | Forgot completely | Resets to learning steps |
| **Hard** | Remembered with difficulty | interval × 1.2, decreases ease factor |
| **Good** | Normal recall | interval × ease factor (default 2.5) |
| **Easy** | Instant recall | interval × ease factor × easy bonus |

### Quizlet: 2 Buttons

| Button | When to use | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Don't Know** | Forgot the card | Card is shown again sooner |
| **Know** | Remembered the card | Card is scheduled for later review |

Quizlet uses a simplified binary grading system. There's no way to distinguish between "remembered with effort" and "remembered easily."

### Key Difference

GoCards offers the most granular control with its unique **"Quick Repetition"** button — a dedicated cramming mode that schedules reviews in minutes instead of days. AnkiDroid provides four levels of recall quality with per-card adaptation. Quizlet keeps it simple with just two choices.

## Spaced Repetition Algorithm

### GoCards

GoCards uses a straightforward multiplier system:

- **Hard:** next interval = current interval × 1.5
- **Easy:** next interval = current interval × 2

**Example (Easy):** 5 days → 10 → 20 → 40 → 80 → 160 days

The progression is predictable. Every card follows the same multiplier regardless of history.

### AnkiDroid

AnkiDroid uses the **SM-2 algorithm** (modified) with a per-card **ease factor**:

- Each card starts with an ease factor of 2.5
- Pressing **"Hard"** decreases the ease factor
- Pressing **"Easy"** increases it
- The ease factor adjusts how aggressively intervals grow

This means two cards with the same interval can grow at different rates depending on how often you've struggled with them.

### Quizlet

Quizlet uses a proprietary scheduling algorithm:

- Cards you mark as **"Don't Know"** appear more frequently
- Cards you mark as **"Know"** appear less often
- Full spaced repetition scheduling requires **Quizlet Plus** (paid subscription)
- The algorithm is not transparent — you can't see or predict intervals

### Which is Better?

- **GoCards** is simpler and more predictable — you always know how intervals will grow
- **AnkiDroid** adapts per-card, which can be more efficient for large collections with varying difficulty
- **Quizlet** is the easiest to use but offers the least control over scheduling
