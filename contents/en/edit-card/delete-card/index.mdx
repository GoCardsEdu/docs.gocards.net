## Undo Options

GoCards uses an **undo-first approach** instead of confirmation dialogs, making deletion quick while still safe:

| Method | How to Undo |
|--------|-------------|
| 💬 **Snackbar** | Tap ↩️ **"Restore"** in the message that appears after deletion |
| ⬅️ **Back button** | Press back immediately after deleting (Study/Edit mode) |

**Note:** The undo option is available for a short time after deletion. Act quickly if you need to restore a card.
