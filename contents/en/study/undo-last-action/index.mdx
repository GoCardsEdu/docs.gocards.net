The app offers two ← Back buttons, each with its own function:

### 1. Exit current activity (top bar)
- Tap **←** in the top bar to close the current screen and return to the **Deck List**

### 2. Undo last action (bottom navigation bar)
- Tap **←** in the bottom navigation bar to undo your most recent action

### What can be undone?

When you tap **←** in the bottom navigation bar, you can:
- **Undo grading** – Go back to the previous card after selecting **Easy, Good, Hard, or Again**
- **Restore a deleted card** – Recover a card you just removed
- **Undo adding a new card** – Remove a newly added card that hasn’t been saved yet
