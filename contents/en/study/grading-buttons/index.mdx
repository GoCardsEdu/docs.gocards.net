## The Four Grading Buttons

After revealing the answer, grade how well you remembered:

### 🔴 Again (Red)

**Use when:** You forgot the card completely

**What happens:**
- Card stays in the current study session
- Reappears after you've studied/forgotten 5 more cards
- Next review: **2 days** (or current interval if already learned)
- Marks card as "forgotten" (visible in card list edge bar)

**Customization:** Change the "forgotten card limit" in [Deck Settings](/en/settings/all-decks#limit-forgotten-cards)

---

### 🟠 Quick Repetition (Orange)

**Use when:** Cramming for an exam or need short-term recall

**What happens:**
- First review: **5 minutes**
- Second review: **10 minutes**
- Third review: **20 minutes**
- Intervals keep doubling

**Perfect for:**
- Last-minute studying before exams
- Memorizing information needed in the next few hours
- Intensive drilling of difficult material

### 🔵 Hard (Blue)

**Use when:** You remembered, but it took effort

**What happens:**

If this is your **first time** grading the card:
- Next review: **3 days**
- Subsequent reviews: **interval × 1.5**

If you previously clicked **"Again"**:
- Updates the failed attempt with **interval × 0.5**
- Creates new review with **interval × 1.5**

**Example progression:**
1. First: 3 days
2. Second: 4.5 days (3 × 1.5)
3. Third: 6.75 days (4.5 × 1.5)

### 🟢 Easy (Green)

**Use when:** You remembered quickly and confidently

**What happens:**

If this is your **first time** grading the card:
- Next review: **5 days**
- Subsequent reviews: **interval × 2**

If you previously clicked **"Again"**:
- Updates the failed attempt with **interval × 0.5**
- Marks card as memorized

**Example progression:**
1. First: 5 days
2. Second: 10 days (5 × 2)
3. Third: 20 days (10 × 2)
4. Fourth: 40 days (20 × 2)

## Understanding Review Intervals

The interval shown below each button is **when you'll see this card again**.

### How Intervals Work

**New cards** (never studied):
- Again: 2 days
- Quick: 5 minutes
- Hard: 3 days
- Easy: 5 days

**Previously studied cards:**
- Intervals adapt based on your history
- More "Easy" clicks = longer intervals
- "Again" clicks = shorter intervals
- The algorithm balances memory retention with study efficiency

### Why These Intervals?

GoCards uses **spaced repetition** based on memory research:
- Review just before you're about to forget
- Longer intervals strengthen long-term memory
- Too frequent = waste of time
- Too infrequent = you'll forget
