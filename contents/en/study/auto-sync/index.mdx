## Auto-Sync

If you've set up [File Sync](/docs/sync-export-import/sync-cards/):

**When study session starts:**
- Automatically syncs with your Excel/CSV file
- Imports any changes from the file
- Updates GoCards with latest card edits

**When study session ends:**
- Syncs progress back to file (if file format supports it)
- Keeps everything up to date

Enable in [Deck Settings](/docs/settings/deck-settings/) → "Auto-Sync"
