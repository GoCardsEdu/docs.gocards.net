## Your First Time Opening GoCards

Let's start in the **All Decks** tab.

## Step 1: Create Your First Deck

[Decks](/en/deck-list) are collections of flashcards organized by topic. Let's create your first one:

1. **Tap the "All Decks" tab** at the bottom
2. **Tap the "+" button** in the bottom-right corner
3. **Enter a name** for your deck (e.g., "Spanish Vocabulary", "Biology Terms")
4. **Tap "Create"**

<center><img src="/images/docs/create-deck.png" width="300" /></center>

Your new deck now appears in the list!

## Step 2: Open the Cards List

The [cards list](/en/cards-list) is where you'll manage all the flashcards in your deck:

1. **Tap "⋮" on a deck** to open the deck menu.
2. **Select "List Cards"**

<center><img src="/images/docs/cards-list-menu.png" width="300" /></center>

You'll see an empty list since we haven't added any cards yet. Let's fix that!

## Step 3: Add Your First Cards

Now let's [add some cards](/en/edit-card/add-card) to your deck:

1. **Tap the "+" button** in the top-right corner
2. **Enter the Term** (the question - front of the card)
3. **Enter the Definition** (the answer - back of the card)
4. **Tap the save icon** (💾) to [save your card](/en/edit-card)

<center><img src="/images/docs/create-deck.png" width="300" /></center>

Repeat to add more cards. Later, you can enhance cards with [HTML formatting](/en/edit-card/html-tags), images, or even YouTube videos.

## Step 4: Study Your Cards

Now it's time to start your [study session](/en/study)!

1. **Go back** to your deck (tap the back arrow)
2. **Tap on the deck** to enter study mode

### Your First Study Session

In study mode, you'll see:
- **Term** at the top (the question)
- **Tap the bottom section** to reveal the definition (answer)
- **Swipe left or right** to navigate between cards

After revealing the answer, grade yourself based on how well you remembered:

| Button | When to Use | Next Review |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Again** (Red) | You forgot | Soon (stays in current session) |
| **Quick** (Orange) | For cramming | 5 minutes |
| **Hard** (Blue) | Remembered with difficulty | 3 days |
| **Easy** (Green) | Remembered easily | 5 days |

Each button shows when you'll see the card again. This is spaced repetition—the app schedules reviews right before you're likely to forget, making learning more efficient. If you prefer to review cards without affecting your study schedule, try [Browse Mode](/en/browse-cards).

## Next Steps

You've created your first deck and learned the basics! As you continue, you'll want to explore:

**Edit cards more efficiently:** Instead of editing cards one-by-one on your phone, you can [sync with Excel or CSV files](/en/sync-export-import/sync-cards) on your computer. Make bulk changes with find-replace, then sync back—without losing your study progress.

**Create richer cards:** Go beyond plain text with [HTML formatting](/en/edit-card/html-tags)—add bold text, images, YouTube videos, and code syntax highlighting to make your cards more engaging.

Happy studying! 🎓
