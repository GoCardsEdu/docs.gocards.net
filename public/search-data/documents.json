    "content": "## What the AI Can Do\n\nThe AI Assistant is a chat panel available inside any deck. You can ask it to:\n\n* **Create cards** — describe a topic and the AI generates term/definition pairs and adds them directly to your deck\n* **Update cards** — ask to rephrase, expand, or correct existing cards\n* **Delete cards** — remove cards by describing which ones to remove\n* **Suggest improvements** — ask for feedback on card quality or coverage\n\nThe AI is aware of your deck name and existing cards, so it can infer the topic without extra instructions.\n\n***\n\n## How to Open the AI Assistant\n\n1. Open any deck (tap it from the **Deck List**)\n2. Tap the **AI floating button** in the bottom-right corner of the screen\n\nThe chat panel opens as a bottom sheet overlay — your card list stays visible behind it.\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/images/docs/card-list-ai-chat.png\" width=\"300\" />\n</center>\n\n***\n\n## Access Options\n\nThere are two ways to use the AI:\n\n### Option 1 — Token Package (Gemini)\n\n1. Tap **Login** inside the AI panel\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Tap **Buy Tokens** to purchase a package of tokens\n4. Start chatting — tokens are deducted automatically per message\n\nThe token balance is shown at the top of the chat panel. You can buy additional packages any time your balance is low.\n\n**Device requirements for purchasing:** The app must be installed from Google Play on a certified, non-rooted Android device with security updates within the last year. This is required by Google Play Integrity API to prevent fraud.\n\n***\n\n### Option 2 — Your Own OpenAI API Key (BYOK)\n\nUse your own OpenAI account and API key — no login to GoCards required.\n\n1. Go to **Settings** → **App Settings** → **OpenAI API Key**\n2. Paste your OpenAI API key\n3. Open the AI panel in any deck and start chatting\n\nCharges are billed directly to your OpenAI account.\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/images/docs/card-list-ai-chat-setup.png\" width=\"300\" />\n</center>\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Edit Card](/en/edit-card) - Manually add or edit cards\n* [App Settings](/en/settings/app) - Set your OpenAI API key\n* [Getting Started](/en/getting-started) - Create your first deck\n",

Let's create your first one:\n\n1. **Tap the \"All Decks\" tab** at the bottom\n2. **Tap the \"+\" button** in the bottom-right corner\n3. **Enter a name** for your deck (e.g., \"Spanish Vocabulary\", \"Biology Terms\")\n4. **Tap \"Create\"**\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/images/docs/create-deck.png\" width=\"300\" />\n</center>\n\nYour new deck now appears in the list!\n\n## Step 2: Open the Cards List\n\nThe [cards list](/en/cards-list) is where you'll manage all the flashcards in your deck:\n\n1. **Tap \"⋮\" on a deck** to open the deck menu.\n2. **Select \"List Cards\"**\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/images/docs/cards-list-menu.png\" width=\"300\" />\n</center>\n\nYou'll see an empty list since we haven't added any cards yet. Let's fix that!\n\n## Step 3: Add Your First Cards\n\nNow let's [add some cards](/en/edit-card/add-card) to your deck:\n\n1. **Tap the \"+\" button** in the top-right corner\n2. **Enter the Term** (the question - front of the card)\n3. **Enter the Definition** (the answer - back of the card)\n4. **Tap the save icon** (💾) to [save your card](/en/edit-card)\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/images/docs/create-deck.png\" width=\"300\" />\n</center>\n\nRepeat to add more cards. Later, you can enhance cards with [HTML formatting](/en/edit-card/html-tags), images, or even YouTube videos.\n\n## Step 4: Study Your Cards\n\nNow it's time to start your [study session](/en/study)!\n\n1. **Go back** to your deck (tap the back arrow)\n2. **Tap on the deck** to enter study mode\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"/images/docs/study-card-slider-more.png\" width=\"300\" />\n</center>\n\n### Your First Study Session\n\nIn study mode, you'll see:\n\n* **Term** at the top (the question)\n* **Tap the bottom section** to reveal the definition (answer)\n* **Swipe left or right** to navigate between cards\n\nAfter revealing the answer, grade yourself based on how well you remembered:\n\n| Button | When to Use | Next Review |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Again** (Red) | You forgot | Soon (stays in current session) |\n| **Quick** (Orange) | For cramming | 5 minutes |\n| **Hard** (Blue) | Remembered with difficulty | 3 days |\n| **Easy** (Green) | Remembered easily | 5 days |\n\nEach button shows when you'll see the card again. This is spaced repetition—the app schedules reviews right before you're likely to forget, making learning more efficient. If you prefer to review cards without affecting your study schedule, try [Browse Mode](/en/browse-cards).\n\n***\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou've created your first deck and learned the basics! As you continue, you'll want to explore:\n\n**Edit cards more efficiently:** Instead of editing cards one-by-one on your phone, you can [sync with Excel or CSV files](/en/sync-export-import/sync-cards) on your computer. Make bulk changes with find-replace, then sync back—without losing your study progress.\n\n**Create richer cards:** Go beyond plain text with [HTML formatting](/en/edit-card/html-tags)—add bold text, images, YouTube videos, and code syntax highlighting to make your cards more engaging.\n\nHappy studying! 🎓\n",

Buttons\n\n| Button | When to use | First review | Growth |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|\n| 🔴 **Again** | Forgot completely | 2 days | Stays in session, reappears after 5 cards |\n| 🟠 **Quick Repetition** | Cramming / short-term recall | 5 minutes | Doubles each time (5 → 10 → 20 min) |\n| 🔵 **Hard** | Remembered with effort | 3 days | interval × 1.5 |\n| 🟢 **Easy** | Remembered quickly | 5 days | interval × 2 |\n\n### AnkiDroid: 4 Buttons\n\n| Button | When to use | Behavior |\n|--------|-------------|----------|\n| **Again** | Forgot completely | Resets to learning steps |\n| **Hard** | Remembered with difficulty | interval × 1.2, decreases ease factor |\n| **Good** | Normal recall | interval × ease factor (default 2.5) |\n| **Easy** | Instant recall | interval × ease factor × easy bonus |\n\n### Quizlet: 2 Buttons\n\n| Button | When to use | Behavior |\n|--------|-------------|----------|\n| **Don't Know** | Forgot the card | Card is shown again sooner |\n| **Know** | Remembered the card | Card is scheduled for later review |\n\nQuizlet uses a simplified binary grading system. There's no way to distinguish between \"remembered with effort\" and \"remembered easily.\"\n\n### Key Difference\n\nGoCards offers the most granular control with its unique **\"Quick Repetition\"** button — a dedicated cramming mode that schedules reviews in minutes instead of days. AnkiDroid provides four levels of recall quality with per-card adaptation. Quizlet keeps it simple with just two choices.\n\nLearn more: [GoCards Grading Buttons](/en/study/grading-buttons)\n\n***\n\n## Spaced Repetition Algorithm\n\n### GoCards\n\nGoCards uses a straightforward multiplier system:\n\n* **Hard:** next interval = current interval × 1.5\n* **Easy:** next interval = current interval × 2\n\n**Example (Easy):** 5 days → 10 → 20 → 40 → 80 → 160 days\n\nThe progression is predictable. Every card follows the same multiplier regardless of history.\n\n### AnkiDroid\n\nAnkiDroid uses the **SM-2 algorithm** (modified) with a per-card **ease factor**:\n\n* Each card starts with an ease factor of 2.5\n* Pressing **\"Hard\"** decreases the ease factor\n* Pressing **\"Easy\"** increases it\n* The ease factor adjusts how aggressively intervals grow\n\nThis means two cards with the same interval can grow at different rates depending on how often you've struggled with them.\n\n### Quizlet\n\nQuizlet uses a proprietary scheduling algorithm:\n\n* Cards you mark as **\"Don't Know\"** appear more frequently\n* Cards you mark as **\"Know\"** appear less often\n* Full spaced repetition scheduling requires **Quizlet Plus** (paid subscription)\n* The algorithm is not transparent — you can't see or predict intervals\n\n### Which is Better?\n\n* **GoCards** is simpler and more predictable — you always know how intervals will grow\n* **AnkiDroid** adapts per-card, which can be more efficient for large collections with varying difficulty\n* **Quizlet** is the easiest to use but offers the least control over scheduling\n\n***\n\n## Who Should Choose Which?\n\n**Choose GoCards if you:**\n\n* Want to edit flashcards in Excel or Google Sheets\n* Need bulk editing with find-replace across hundreds of cards\n* Prefer gesture-based study (swipe, pinch, drag)\n* Study programming and want built-in code highlighting\n* Want to embed YouTube videos in cards\n* Prefer a simpler, more predictable spaced repetition system\n\n**Choose AnkiDroid if you:**\n\n* Want cloze deletions or custom card templates\n* Rely on shared deck libraries\n* Need audio playback on cards\n* Prefer a per-card adaptive algorithm\n* Use Anki Desktop and want cross-platform sync via AnkiWeb\n\n**Choose Quizlet if you:**\n\n* Want the easiest setup with no learning curve\n* Prefer multiple study modes (Learn, Test, Match)\n* Need text-to-speech pronunciation\n* Want to quickly find and use sets made by other students\n* Don't need advanced formatting or code support\n\n***\n\n## Getting Started with GoCards\n\nReady to try GoCards?\n\n1. **[Download GoCards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.gocards\\&referrer=utm_source%3Ddocs.gocards.net%26utm_content%3Dgocards-vs-anki)** from the Google Play Store\n2. **[Create your first deck](/en/getting-started/)** and add some cards\n3. **[Learn about sync](/en/sync-export-import/sync-cards/)** to unlock the full power of GoCards\n",

quizlet quizlet uses a proprietary scheduling algorithm: cards you mark as don t know appear more frequently cards you mark as know appear less often full spaced repetition scheduling requires quizlet plus paid subscription the algorithm is not transparent you can t see or predict intervals which is better gocards is simpler and more predictable you always know how intervals will grow ankidroid adapts per-card which can be more efficient for large collections with varying difficulty quizlet is the easiest to use but offers the least control over scheduling who should choose which choose gocards if you: want to edit flashcards in excel or google sheets need bulk editing with find-replace across hundreds of cards prefer gesture-based study swipe pinch drag study programming and want built-in code highlighting want to embed youtube videos in cards prefer a simpler more predictable spaced repetition system choose ankidroid if you: want cloze deletions or custom card templates rely on shared deck libraries need audio playback on cards prefer a per-card adaptive algorithm use anki desktop and want cross-platform sync via ankiweb choose quizlet if you: want the easiest setup with no learning curve prefer multiple study modes learn test match need text-to-speech pronunciation want to quickly find and use sets made by other students don t need advanced formatting or code support

    "content": "## Why Sync Instead of Import?\n\n**The Problem with Traditional Apps:**\n\nMost flashcard apps only support importing files. Every time you update your flashcards, you have to delete the old deck and import a new one, losing all your study progress in the process.\n\n**The GoCards Solution:**\n\nSync your deck once, then edit the file anytime. Changes flow automatically in both directions while your learning statistics, due dates, and mastery levels stay intact.\n\n***\n\n## How Sync Works\n\nGoCards uses smart synchronization that compares modification dates to determine which source has the newest changes.\n\n### Intelligent Card Matching\n\nWhen syncing, GoCards automatically detects whether a card has been modified or is entirely new:\n\n* 🟠 **Modified cards** - Updated if there's at least 70% similarity in the term or definition (prevents accidental overwrites)\n* 🟢 **New cards** - Added automatically if similarity is below 70%\n* 🔴 **Deleted cards** - Removed if they no longer exist in the source\n\nThis smart matching ensures your edits are preserved while preventing duplicate cards.\n\n### What Gets Synced\n\n**When the file is newer than the deck:**\n\n* 🟢 New cards from the file are added\n* 🔴 Deleted cards are removed\n* 🟠 Modified cards are updated\n* Card order matches the file\n* Study progress is preserved\n\n**When the card is newer than the file:**\n\n* 🟠 Changes from the card are written back to the file\n* Custom columns in your spreadsheet are preserved and move with their cards\n\n***\n\n## See It in Action\n\nWatch how sync works in practice:\n\n<center>\n  <iframe width=\"395\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rthjtSAq13A?si=ipRAJYeRNYG1ermM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerPolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowFullScreen />\n</center>\n\n**What happens in this demo:**\n\n1. A deck is exported to create a synced file\n2. Changes are made to both the file (3 cards) and the app (3 cards)\n3. Sync is triggered\n4. The card list shows what changed with color indicators\n5. Study progress remains intact despite the updates\n\n***\n\n## Visual Sync Indicators\n\nAfter syncing, colored edge bars in your card list show exactly which cards changed.\n\nLearn more in [Edge Bars](/en/cards-list/edge-bars).\n\n***\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n✅ **Preserve Study Progress** - Never lose your learning statistics again\n\n✅ **Bi-directional Sync** - Changes flow both ways automatically\n\n✅ **Edit Anywhere** - Update cards on laptop or phone\n\n✅ **Cloud Storage Integration** - Works with Google Drive, Dropbox, and more\n\n✅ **Smart Conflict Resolution** - Prevents accidental data loss with similarity checking\n\n✅ **Extra Data Preserved** - Keep custom columns in your spreadsheet intact\n\n***\n\n## Supported File Formats\n\n**Excel (.xlsx, .xls)**\n\n* Compatible with Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc\n\n**CSV (.csv)**\n\n* Universal compatibility with any text editor or spreadsheet program\n\nSee the [File Format Guide](/en/sync-export-import/file-format/) for detailed specifications.\n\n***\n\n## Related Topics\n\n* [Export Cards](/en/sync-export-import/export-cards) - Create a new Excel/CSV file from a deck\n* [Import Cards](/en/sync-export-import/import-cards) - Create a deck from an existing file\n* [File Format](/en/sync-export-import/file-format) - Understand the required file structure\n* [Why Use Excel/CSV](/en/sync-export-import/why-use-excel-csv) - Benefits of computer editing\n* [Auto-Sync](/en/study/auto-sync) - Enable automatic syncing during study sessions\n",

    "content": "These terms and conditions apply to the GoCards app (hereby referred to as \"Application\") for mobile devices that was created by Grzegorz Z (hereby referred to as \"Service Provider\") as a Freemium service.\n\nUpon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.\n\nUnauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.\n\nThe Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.\n\nThe Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.\n\nPlease note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:\n\n* [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)\n* [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/)\n* [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)\n\nPlease be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.\n\nIf you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.\n\nSimilarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.\n\nIn terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.\n\nThe Application incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to provide certain features or services. By using the Application, you acknowledge and agree that AI may be used to process data and deliver functionalities. The Service Provider ensures that all AI usage complies with applicable laws and is designed to benefit the user experience.\n\nThe Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.\n\n### Changes to These Terms and Conditions\n\nThe Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.\n\nThese terms and conditions are effective as of 2026-02-23\n\n### Contact Us\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to contact the Service Provider at gocards.edu@gmail.com.\n\n***\n\nThis Terms and Conditions page was generated by [App Privacy Policy Generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/)\n",
